## A code that is based in a game, that every time someone says a multiple of 3 they have to replace for the word fizz.
## This person has to count until 100, making the replacements that are required.

## When a multiple appers you have to change to the word buzz.
## And when a multiple of 5 and 3 appers you have to chenge for buzz fizz.

## Exemple: 1,2 fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,buzz fizz ....

for i in range(1,101):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i%5 == 0: 
      print("fizz")
    elif i%5 == 0:
      print("buzz")
    elif i%3 == 0:
      print("buzz fizz")
    elif i%3 != 0 and i%5 != 0:
      print(i)
